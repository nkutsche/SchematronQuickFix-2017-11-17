# Data Type Support 

For User Entries in SQF it is possible to define a data type. 
The Escali Plugin supports the following data types: 

- xs:integer 
- xs:string 
- xs:double 
- xs:date 
- xs:time 
- xs:boolean

If one UserEntry is assigned to one of this data types, the plugin provides a specific graphical inerface to help user to enter the value correctly, valid to the corresponding type.

For example the type xs:date will trigger a calendar to choose the date easily or the input field for an xs:integer will not allow any characters.
