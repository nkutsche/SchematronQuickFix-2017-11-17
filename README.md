# Escali Oxygen Plugin Presentation

This project contains a small documentation, slides and sample files for the 
[Escali Oxygen Plugin](https://github.com/schematron-quickfix/escali-package#escali-oxygen-plugin).

The slides and the sample files are based on a presentation I give (in German) at the
[Markupforum 2017](http://www.markupforum.de/programm.html#v7) on November 17, 2017 and more detailed at the XUGS meeting on November 29, 2017. 

## Project content

The slides are available in the formats [PDF](SQF-Escali.pdf) and [PowerPoint](SQF-Escali.pptx).
